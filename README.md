**Implementation:** `scr/problem10_update_derivation.py`

**Complete mathematical proof:**

Starting from:
```
θⱼ := θⱼ - ∂/∂θⱼ J(θ)
```

**Derivation steps:**
1. Apply chain rule to J(θ) = (1/2m)∑[hθ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾]²
2. Compute partial derivative: ∂J/∂θⱼ
3. Simplify using ∂hθ(x)/∂θⱼ = xⱼ
4. Arrive at final update rule

**Final formula:**
```
θⱼ := θⱼ - α(1/m)∑[(hθ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾)xⱼ⁽ⁱ⁾]
```

**Includes numerical verification** demonstrating the derivation is correct.

---

### Problem 11: Convexity and Global Optimum (Advanced) ✅
**Implementation:** `scr/problem11_local_optimum.py`

**Mathematical proof of convexity:**

**Theorem:** Linear regression has NO local optima.

**Proof:**
1. The Hessian H = (1/m)XᵀX is positive semi-definite
2. For any vector v: vᵀHv = (1/m)||Xv||² ≥ 0
3. Positive semi-definite Hessian ⟹ Convex function
4. Convex function ⟹ Unique global minimum

**Implications:**
✓ Gradient descent ALWAYS finds global optimum  
✓ No risk of local minima  
✓ Initial parameters don't affect final solution  
✓ Reliable, predictable optimization  

**Output:** `plots/problem11_convex_surface.png`
- 3D visualization of bowl-shaped cost surface
- Contour plots showing convergence paths
- Hessian eigenvalue analysis
- Comparison with non-convex functions
